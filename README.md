# Vue-List

This app is for me to practice with Vue js and working with Node js
For the backend I am using Express Js as a middle ware
As for a databse I am using mongodb

In order to run locally download folder then

- run npm i, to install packages to project
- run npm run dev, to start local development environment
- Also must have own mongo db set up for local env, else go here <--------------> for live site
